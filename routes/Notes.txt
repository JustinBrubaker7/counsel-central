1. Inside of index.js is where I mapped out the router usage ino the different
   routes. Currently laid out are

   - logRoutes /api/log
        This is where the login/logout functions occur

   - adminRoutes /api/admin
        This is where the crud of counselors takes place

   - counselorRoutes /api/counselor
        This is where the crud of residents takes place

   - getRoutes /api/get
        This is where all the general get info is, returning all of something

   - calendarRoutes /api/date
        This will be where the calendar events will be

   - noteRoutes /api/note
        This is where the CRUD of notes takes place

   - authRoutes /api/auth
        This is where I am planning on having the authentication take place.
        Send the token to this route, { isVerified ? Go : No }

2. Things I need to be able to move forward

- Notes model 
- Comments model
- Counselor model
- Resident model
- Center model

- relational data setup

3. General Notes

- I can always change my creation parameters to match the models so you guys can 
  determine what you want the foreign keys to be called and so fourth. I can change
  my code to match.

- Also any sort of naming conventions you guys discuss I can also change to match
  just let me know.

- I have tested some routes out and they are working in Insomniac on port :3001

- Also let me know if the structural change messed up anything on the react end of 
  things, the way it was structured before involved using one single long page of
  javascript with every route existing under a single "/api" route. My change just
  made more sense to me in the moment.
